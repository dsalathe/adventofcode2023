#Scala implementation of Day 2 

## Algorithms
No special algorithms were used for this problem.

### Performances
#### part 1
- Compiling + running using `scala part1.scala input.txt` takes around 2.15s.
- Running only with `./Part1JVM input.txt` (packaged with scala-cli) takes around 0.22s
- Running the native version using scala native with `./Part1Native input.txt` takes around 0.008s

The native version is 27x faster

#### part 2
- Compiling + running using `scala part2.scala input.txt` takes around 2.28s.
- Running only with `./Part2JVM input.txt` (packaged with scala-cli) takes around 0.27s
- Running the native version using scala native with `./Part2Native input.txt` takes around 0.016s

The native version is 17x faster
