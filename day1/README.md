## Performances
### part 1
- Compiling + running using `scala part1.scala input.txt` takes around 1.910s.
- Running only with `./Part1JVM input.txt` (packaged with scala-cli) takes around 0.183s
- Running the native version using scala native with `./Part1Native input.txt` takes around 0.002s

The native version is 90x faster

### part 2 (Simple)
- Compiling + running using `scala part2Simple.scala input.txt` takes around 1.938s.
- Running only with `./Part2JVM input.txt` (packaged with scala-cli) takes around 0.210s
- Running the native version using scala native with `./Part2Native input.txt` takes around 0.002s

The native version is 105x faster

### part 2 (Tries)
- Compiling + running using `scala part2Tries.scala input.txt` takes around 2.59s.
- Running only with `./Part2JVM input.txt` (packaged with scala-cli) takes around 0.244s
- Running the native version using scala native with `./Part2Native input.txt` takes around 0.005s

The native version is 17x faster
